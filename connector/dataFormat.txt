1. Motor controller
	{"motroControlerId":"motor0","timestamp":"", "targetStatus":"open"} // value of "targetStatus" could be "open"/"close"
2. Light controller

* A problem to discuss:
The figure takes by the infraed camera is not sent to health monitor (the cost is too large), so when health monitor finds a person with abnormal temperature, it should notice the administrator in telegram, and the administrator should be able to get the figure in order to find the person. Will it be able to let the telegram get the pictuer through REST api or some other method directly form raspi?
